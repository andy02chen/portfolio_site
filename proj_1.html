          This project was developed in a group of 3. The site is basic as we were not experience with web development.          
          It was written in Python using the Flask framework and SQLite was used for the database. 
          This site has a homepage and cart features which allow the user to store items and checkout. There is a user role, for purchasing items, and admin role 
          for managing items and orders. The admin is able to add products, edit products, delete products and manage orders.
          I was responsible for setting up the backend, developing the login/register pages, admin pages and helping with other parts of the site such as the home page and cart.
          <br>

          For the backend, Flask was chosen because it is a simple framework that the group has used in a previous unit. 
          SQLite was chosen for the database because it is also easy to use. Rather than needing a server, the data is stored in RAM, so setting up was very simple.
          The database has 3 tables, one for user, orders and products. Users have a unique id and the orders table has a foreign key which points to it.
          This it to link the order to the user. The order table could've been improved as the items are just stored as a string.
          I made this choice to make displaying the order easier, it could be improved by having a separate column for quantity and a foreign key pointing to the product_id.

          Images of the site:
          <br>
          <br>
          The homepage is implemented by querying the DB and getting all the products. Then using a loop to display them.
          <!-- TODO add an image -->
          <br>
          <br>
          The cart feature is implemented by using URL parameters to redirect and edit a dictionary. 
          In the cart you are able to select quantity from a drop menu or remove the item entirely from the cart.
          <!-- TODO add an image -->
          <br>
          <br>
          The add projects page enables the admin add new items. 
          <!-- TODO add an image -->
          <br>
          <br>
          The admin can also edit products by selecting the id from a dropdown menu. It displays the Old (current) details and allows the admin to change them.
          <!-- TODO add an image -->
          <br>
          <br>
          Deleting items can be done by selecting the item id.
          <!-- TODO add an image -->
          <br>
          <br>
          The admin can edit the order status.
