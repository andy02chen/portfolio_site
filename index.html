						Hello!
					</p>
					<p class="small_txt">
						My name is <span class="make-blue">Andy Chen</span>, I am an aspiring Software Developer.
						I am 21 years old. I graduated from the University of Sydney (DEC 2023) with a Bachelor of Computing
						majoring in Computer Science. This bio will help you get to know me but won't go into detail about my skills and experience as they can be found <a href="./files/Andy CHEN Resume.pdf" download>here </a>
						. This portfolio website will showcase my projects while also allowing me to improve my web development skills.
						<br>
						<br>
						I have studied Python, Java and C during Uni. However, I am more comfortable with Python and Java.
						I am planning to learn JavaScript and develop a web app as well as a Java App to refresh my knowledge of Java.
						<br>
						<br>
						My hobbies include watching anime/tv and films, listening to music, playing games and Muay Thai (I have been training for a few years but still regularly get my bottom kicked at training). 
						My favourite games are currently Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, Honkai: Star Rail, The Last of Us and Part 2, and Detroit: Become Human.
						<br>
						Arcane, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, Sousou no Frieren and Bleach are my favourite shows. I don't have a favourite genre or artist/band but I listen to a lot of pop, hip hop, and electronic music.
						<br>
						<br>						
						I'm interested in Technology and Computers. I chose this degree because I enjoyed Software Design and Development,
						and Information Processes and Technology in high School. I also got first place in both subjects in my cohort.
						I try to stay updated on the latest tech products through social media such as YouTube, Reddit and TikTok.
						<br>
