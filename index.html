							Hello!
						</p>
						<p class="small_txt">
							My name is <span class="make-blue">Andy Chen</span>, I am an aspiring Software Developer.
							I am 21 years old. I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Computing
							majoring in Computer Science. This bio will help you get to know me but won't go into detail about my skills and experience as they can be found <a href="./files/Andy CHEN Resume.pdf" download>here</a>
							. This portfolio website will showcase my projects while also allowing me to improve my web development skills.
							<br>
							<br>
							I have studied Python, Java and C during Uni. However, I am more comfortable with Python and JavaScript. I first started Python in Year 11 of high school
							and I am currently learning web development and have been writing a lot of JavaScript. I recently been developing a site to track anime and episode releases, which can be viewed in my Projects section below. 
							This site uses APIs to retrive anime and estimates the next episodes release and can also update data on MyAnimeList.
							<br>
							<br>
							My hobbies include watching anime/tv and films, listening to music, playing games, exercising and Muay Thai. 
							<br>
							<br>
							My favourite games are currently Cyberpunk 2077, Honkai: Star Rail, The Last of Us Series, and Detroit: Become Human.
							<br>
							Arcane, Invincible, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, Sousou no Frieren and Bleach are some of my favourite shows. 
							I watch stuff that aren't animated too. The Boys, The Last of Us and The Grand Tour are some other shows that I love.
							I usually prefer genres such as Action, Adventure, or Sci-Fi. I have also started getting into the horror genre.
							<br>
							<br>
							I also enjoying listening to stories/podcasts such as The No Sleep Podcast and Freaky Folklore on Spotify. 
							I listen genres such as pop, hip hop, and electronic music. My favourite band is probably Chase Atlantic.
							<br>
							<br>							
							I have also started reading manga and novels. I am currently collecting Chainsaw Man manga, and reading Bleach: Can't Fear Your Own World. I plan on reading Cyberpunk 2077: No Coincidence next.
							Some books that I have enjoyed reading are The Witcher series and Ruination: A League of Legends Novel. 
							<br>
							<br>						
							I'm interested in Technology and Computers. I chose Bachelor of Computing because I enjoyed Software Design and Development,
							and Information Processes and Technology in high School. I also got first place in both subjects in my cohort.
							I try to stay updated on the latest tech products through social media such as YouTube, Reddit and TikTok.
