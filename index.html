						My name is Andy Chen, I am an aspiring Software Developer.
						I am 21 years old. I graduated from the University of Sydney (DEC 2023) with a Bachelor of Computing
						majoring in Computer Science. This bio will help you get to know me but won't go into detail about my skills and experience as they can be found <a href="./files/Andy CHEN Resume.pdf" download>here </a>
						. This portfolio website will showcase my projects while also allowing me to improve my web development skills.
						<br>
						<br>
						I have studied Python, Java and C during Uni. However, I am more comfortable with Python and Java.
						I am planning to learn JavaScript and develop a web app as well as a Java App to refresh my knowledge of Java.
						<br>
						<br>
						My hobbies include watching anime, listening to music, playing games and Muay Thai (I been training for a few years but still regularly get my bottom kicked at training). 
						My Favourite games are currently Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, Honkai: Star Rail, The Last of Us and Part 2, and Detroit: Become Human.
						I'm interested in Technology and Computers and I try to stay updated on the latest tech products.
